<h2>WHAT WE DO</h2>

<P>We ensure that we deal with both our grown-ups and our young doggies.
    We deal with them like family, so we ensure that they are sound and cheerful from our home to yours.</P><br>

<br>
<h2>REGISTERED</h2>
<p>Our puppies are enlisted and come from champion lines.
    While you might not have any desire to show your pup, 
    this guarantees you get a baby that is sound and has a positive personality.</p>

<br>
We keep our young doggies current on inoculations up until the hour of delivery and 
they will have a veterinarian wellbeing check prior to leaving us. Each of our doggies 
accompany AKC papers and come from champion lines. In spite of the fact that you might 
not have any desire to show your doggy, family is vital with regards to wellbeing and personality.
